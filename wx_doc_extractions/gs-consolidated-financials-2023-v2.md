In 2023, the group transferred its U.K. asset management business to Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI), GS Group’s primary U.K. asset management entity, consistent with GS Group’s resolution planning and the commercial objectives of its asset management business. This business had average annual net revenues of $436 million in 2020 to 2022, approximately 300 employees and immaterial assets and liabilities as of the date of transfer. 

As consideration for the transfer, the group received a non- controlling interest in GSAMI’s immediate parent undertaking, which was measured at fair value through profit or loss, resulting in a gain of $1.42 billion being recognised in net revenues in 2023. The total consideration received was distributed by the group in the fourth quarter of 2023. As such, there was no change in the group’s shareholder’s equity as of December 2023, compared with December 2022, as a result of this transaction. 

# Future Outlook 

The directors consider that the year end financial position of the group was satisfactory.

# Report on the audit of the non-statutory financial statements 

## Opinion 

In our opinion, Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited’s non-statutory group financial statements (the “financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the basis of preparation and accounting policies in note 1 to the financial statements. 

We have audited the financial statements, included within the consolidated financial information, which comprise: consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023; consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information. 

## Basis for opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”), including ISA (UK) 800 and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

### Independence 

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 

## Emphasis of matter - Basis of preparation 

In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not modified, we draw attention to note 1 to the financial statements which describes the basis of preparation, and in particular, the fact that the accounting policies used and disclosures made are not intended to, and do not, comply with the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with a special purpose framework for the directors for the specific purpose as described in the Use of this report paragraph below. As a result, the financial statements may not be suitable for another purpose. 

In addition, we draw attention to the fact that these financial statements have not been prepared under section 394 of the Companies Act 2006 and are not the company’s statutory financial statements. 

## Conclusions relating to going concern 

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. 

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. 

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. 

## Reporting on other information 

The other information comprises all of the information in the consolidated financial information other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance thereon. 

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. 

## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 

Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements 

As explained more fully in the statement of directors responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the basis of preparation and accounting policies in note 1 to the financial statements and for determining that the basis of preparation and accounting policies are acceptable in the circumstances. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. 

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the rules of the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") and Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA"), and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as corporate tax legislation. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting of inappropriate journal entries and management bias through the manipulation of the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included: 

* • Discussions with management, including Internal Audit, and those charged with governance in relation to known or suspected
* • Evaluating and testing of the operating effectiveness of management’s controls designed to prevent and detect fraud in financial
* • Assessing matters reported on the company’s whistleblowing helpline and the results of management’s investigation of such matters;
* • Reviewing key correspondence with regulatory authorities(the FCA and the PRA);
* • Identifying and testing selected journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted by senior management, account owners,
* • Challenging assumptions and judgments made by management in their critical accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the
* • Incorporating unpredictability into the nature, timing and/or extent of our testing. instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud; reporting; individuals in particular departments (including front office) and unusual account combinations with a credit to revenue; valuation of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value; and

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non- compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. 

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report. 

### Use of this report 

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s directors as a body for management purposes and in support of the consolidated Pillar III disclosures of the UK regulated group in accordance with our engagement letter dated 10 May 2024 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come, including without limitation under any contractual obligations of the company, save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
